## Build Language Large Model (LLM) from scratch

Implementation of a simple language model using bigrams to train on a text dataset, in this case the text from "Crime and Punishment" book. This repo contains the basic flow of data preparation, model definition, training, and text generation using PyTorch.

This model is simpler and more limited than more complex models, such as deep neural network models, but it is useful for understanding the basics of language modeling.
